NOTES UPDATED 7/3/2014
Alex's Notes
    (7/2/2014)
    - Working on firing bubble. Current problem is accessing the bubbleStack list. When I try to pop/get the bubble to be fired it says that it
    is not callable and throws an exception. Spent a good amount of time troubleshooting to no avail. (Fire, gameScreen.fireBubble, if bubble
    isn't parked then move, get direction,... more methods that need implementation).
    - Added a "redraw" method for screen and cannon. Checks and loads cannon if needed.
    - Rotation of cannon working.
    (7/1/2014)
    - Comments added up until the bubble class. Some noted TODO are getting the rotation of cannon to work, better cannon graphic, and learning/implementing pygame sprites..and more.
    - Finally got the chain to be recognized - Finished debugging (swapped while loop for for loop and worked every test)
    - Need to comment code -- will probably spend time writing good comments.
    (Late June)
    - Been working on recognizing the chain. Made some good progress and as you can see based on the True's when you run the code there are some connections being made.
    - My work will continue to polish this backend chain identification. You will notice I added more methods to the Bubble class and completely got RID of the placeBubble method.
    - Hashs (#) that are all the way to the left represents Code that is commented out. I also denoted most of my comments with a Date (6/25/14) so you can see what I did.
    - Also note: The GameWorld class does not really do anything right now... It will be used once the graphics and mechanis are done and we can add levels, moving bubbles, etc.
    - Let me know if you have any questions

<<<<<<< HEAD
	(7/2/2014)
    - Noticed that, at least in the console window, you can move the cannon and fire at the same time
    (7/3/2014)
     - Before firing the bubble, a little calculation needs to be done. I believe that that angle of the open sector of the cannon is pi/2 to start, then either adding or subtracting
    - DEG_TO_RAD depending on turning the cannon left or right

    - Noticed that, at least in the console window, you can move the cannon and fire at the same time. It will be easier to see when we actually have a bubble firing
    	- Checked with the old game. This doesn't matter because once up is pressed, the ball is fired and another one won't be loaded.
